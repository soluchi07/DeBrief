# DeBrief ‚Äì Fandom Social Media Web App

**Author:** Soluchi Fidel-Ibeabuchi
**Role:** Developer | Computer Science Student @ Howard University

DeBrief is a **modern fandom-focused social platform** built with **React, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to share posts about TV shows, movies, and fandoms with **episode-specific discussions, spoiler tagging, authentication, and community-driven interactions**.

This project was developed as my **final submission for a Web Development course**, and demonstrates my ability to design and implement **full-stack applications with authentication, CRUD functionality, and responsive UI/UX.** Deployed on Netlify at 'https://debrief.netlify.app/'

## ‚ö° Challenges & Learnings

During development, I strengthened my skills in:

* **Authentication & Security:** Implemented RLS policies to enforce data ownership and prevent unauthorized access.
* **State Management:** Balanced client-side vs. server-side rendering for efficient filtering and sorting.
* **Async Handling:** Debugged Supabase queries, managed loading states, and avoided null/undefined errors.
* **UI/UX:** Designed responsive layouts with dark mode and intuitive navigation.
* **Routing & Data Flow:** Integrated React Router with protected routes while ensuring smooth user experience.

This project highlighted the importance of **secure coding practices, scalable database design, and user-centric features** in modern web apps.
